        <h5>1. Informative Text</h5>
        Groundhogs, also known as woodchucks, are small mammals belonging to the marmot family. They are found mostly in North America, especially in the United States and Canada. Groundhogs are known for their burrowing habits and their ability to hibernate during the cold winter months. They dig large underground tunnels where they live, sleep, and raise their young. These tunnels help protect them from predators such as foxes and coyotes. Groundhogs mainly eat plants, including grass, leaves, and vegetables from gardens. In popular culture, they are famous for “Groundhog Day,” a tradition in which people watch to see if a groundhog sees its shadow to predict the weather.

        <h5>2. Descriptive Text</h5>
        A groundhog is a furry, chubby animal with short legs and a round body. Its thick brown fur keeps it warm even in cold weather, and its small dark eyes make it look alert and curious. Groundhogs usually measure about 40 to 65 centimeters in length and weigh between 2 and 6 kilograms. They have strong claws that are perfect for digging deep burrows in the soil. During summer, you can often see them standing on their hind legs, looking around carefully before returning to eat. They are shy creatures but very intelligent, knowing exactly when to hide and when to come out.

        <h5>3. Fun Facts Text</h5>
        Did you know that groundhogs are actually excellent weather forecasters—at least according to tradition? Every year on February 2nd, people in North America celebrate Groundhog Day. If the groundhog comes out of its burrow and sees its shadow, legend says there will be six more weeks of winter. If it doesn’t see its shadow, spring will come early. Another fun fact is that groundhogs can climb trees and swim, even though they spend most of their time underground. They hibernate for several months, during which their heart rate and body temperature drop dramatically to save energy.

        Groundhogs may look small and cute, but they are actually incredible animals with some surprising abilities! For example, did you know that a groundhog can climb trees and even swim? Even though they spend most of their time underground, they are strong and flexible creatures.
They are also nature’s engineers — their burrows are like tiny cities with different rooms for sleeping, eating, and raising their young. Groundhogs hibernate during the winter, sleeping for months while their heart rate drops from about 80 beats per minute to just 5!
And of course, we can’t forget Groundhog Day — the fun tradition where people watch to see if a groundhog sees its shadow to predict the coming of spring. Whether it’s real science or just folklore, it’s a charming way to celebrate one of nature’s cutest animals.

        Early in the morning, the sun rises over the field, and a small groundhog pokes its head out of its burrow. Its brown fur shines in the light, and it sniffs the air carefully before stepping out. The world is quiet except for the rustling of grass and the chirping of birds. Slowly, the groundhog begins to search for breakfast — fresh clover and wildflowers.
As the day warms up, it explores the area, always alert for danger. If it senses movement, it quickly dives back into its tunnel for safety. After eating, it spends some time grooming its fur and resting near the entrance of its burrow. Groundhogs live a peaceful life, but they are very clever and cautious animals. When evening comes, it returns underground, safe and ready to rest until another sunny day arrives.
